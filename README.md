* The average temperature in June is 75 degress while the average temperature in December is 71 degrees, only a 4 degree difference.

* Based on the visualization graphs above, the frequency of temperatures in June are skewed more towards the left while the frequency of temperatures in December are symmetrical.

* Based on the Summary Statistics, the standard deviation for both months are low which suggests that the temperatures throughout the month does not change drastically.

## Summary

The temperatures in June and December stays rather consistent and only have an average difference of 4 degrees. Based on the temperature information gathered, I would recommend that the ice cream and surf shop should stay open throughout the entirety of the year since Oahu's temperature does not fluctuate through the seasons. Nevertheless, further analysis and queries should be made to make this important decision.

  1. Although the temperature may be similar, precipitation is an important factor when deciding to surf or eat ice cream. An additional query to understand average precipitation should be conducted for these months.
  
  2. Another important variable would be to analyze the amount of average sunlight throughtout the year. If there is a relatively low amount of sunlight in some months, it may be wise to reduce operational hours or remain closed to save on costs.
